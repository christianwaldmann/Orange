Orange is an early-stage interactive application and rendering engine for Windows. Currently not much is implemented. It is heavily based on the [Hazel Engine](https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel).

## Getting Started

Visual Studio 2019 is recommended, Orange is officially untested on other development environments whilst we focus on a Windows build.

You can clone the repository to a local destination using git:

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/christianwaldmann/Orange`

Make sure that you do a `--recursive` clone to fetch all of the submodules!

### Main features to come:

-   Fast 2D rendering (UI, particles, sprites, etc.)
-   High-fidelity Physically-Based 3D rendering (this will be expanded later, 2D to come first)
-   Support for Mac, Linux, Android and iOS
    -   Native rendering API support (DirectX, Vulkan, Metal)
-   Fully featured viewer and editor applications
-   Fully scripted interaction and behavior
-   Integrated 3rd party 2D and 3D physics engine
-   Procedural terrain and world generation
-   Artificial Intelligence
-   Audio system
